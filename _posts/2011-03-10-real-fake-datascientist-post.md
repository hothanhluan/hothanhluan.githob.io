There is a simple blood test for that. You just need to give up about two pints of your life juice.

Joking aside, here are a few tell tale signs of real and fake data scientists.

REAL: Knows how to perform an ETL task from a local or cloud stored database. You can’t do a thing without data. Most of the time data will not be handed to you in your preferred format. (unless you are already senior and have minions down the office who do the dirty work for you)

FAKE: Thinks databases are beneath him (I use the male pronoun here because women are rarely this delusional). Thinks SQL is analyst’s business.

REAL: Have at least a few years formal or practical training (experience) in predictive and inferential statistics. Insights do not come from the sky (unless you are Jesus, or Moses). Even when you create a stunning data visualization that shows patterns and relationships you need to back that up with hypothesis tests and confidence intervals and (I know it is a bore, but) p-values. You may never have to report these but these are the ultimate robustness checks for your pretty model.

FAKE: Statistical tests are so passe now. I have this new visualization method. It will blow your mind. A picture is worth more than a thousand words.

REAL: Knows the theory / conceptualization behind the following (at minimum): Linear regression, Logistic regression, Principle components analysis (needed for factor analysis as well), cluster analysis, A/B testing, Type I error, Type II error, fit/misfit, over fitting. (Note, these are the minimum you need. If you also want to venture into ML or AI more seriously then you cannot avoid Neural Networks, Natural Language Processing, Decision Trees, etc.)

FAKE: Hey I downloaded the latest Jupyter Network and I also know Pandas. Look, I tweaked an existing UCI Machine learning dataset to replicate some result from two years ago. I also put it on my github account. I am ready to roll baby

REAL: Knows that 70 percent of data science is usually getting your data ready for analysis. Have experience cleaning and transforming messy data (Have you seen the Netflix data with 90 percent rows having missing values? Hmmm…). Is aware that world generates messy data with missing values, inconsistent labels, typos, inconsistent capitalization and the like. Also knows that getting data ready to analyze is as crucial as applying the most complicated ML algorithm. After all, you can sing only as well as your data sings.

FAKE: Thinks data preparation is just an overture to the real stuff.

And finally data scientists, or lets say professionals who have been deriving insight from data for a living, generally tend to realize that they work in a rather fluid industry with lots of cross field feedback. Most data scientists tend to have (on top of their technical acumen) domain specific experience (i.e. experience with the real world process that generates the data they have to work with). This means that they understand the data generating process and can anticipate problems that can emerge during the data collection and/or processing. They tend to possess a degree of natural curiosity to get them interested in the task and do some research about the specific domain (at least I do).
